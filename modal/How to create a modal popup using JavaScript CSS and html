how to make a close button(X) for beginners (3 proven methods that works)

    1. Using  html only 
    2. Using font awesome icon
    3. Using html and css only

Using html only
You can use the letter x for close buttons. However, the multiplication symbol looks much better than the letter x for close buttons. You write the multication symbol as &times; in html. It is a html entity.[[link html entities article here]]  
To ensure this method always works for you, include the meta tag  charset to UTF-8 (<meta charset="UTF-8">), on the head of each page.
